This is a project I will use to learn more of the data science and visualization of data aspects of coding.
This program uses matplotlib to build off of, and is basically me exploring various types of data representations within the library.

grasping basics:
    mpl_squares
        Playing with basic initial settings and rendering usint matplotlib
    scatter_squares
        Playing with scatter plotting using both axis, as well as slightly more complex data structures.
    random_walk
        Stores a class as well as initialization attributes for generating random walk points
    rw_visual
        Uses a scatter plot to map the points of random walk.
    die
        Stores the class housing dice attributes, and methods.
    die_visual
        Is used to generate a visual representation of the frequencies of each number being rold at random/ determined sample size. Which is rendered into a .svg file whic can be viewed in the browser.

World_population_visualization
    highs_lows
        This will be used to parse and compare Weather data stored in CSV format.
    world_population
        This is used to parse through Json files and map world population counts to a redered visual.
    country_codes
        Stores fucntion to search and apply the country code.
    countries
        produces the list of countries used in other files.
    americas
        Renders and highlights the Americas in a seperats generated svg file.
    na_populations
        This was the test run of learning how to render both desired data sets on the same visual.
    world_population
        Renders an interactive map of the globe highlighting population size by country in 2010

python_repos
    Basic git hub api call to extract data needed for visualization referencing repos using python as the main language.
hn_submissions
    Uses the hacker news API to generate a list of top stories, links, and related comments.
