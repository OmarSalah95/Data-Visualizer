This is a project I will use to learn more of the data science and visualization of data aspects of coding.
This program uses matplotlib to build off of, and is basically me exploring various types of data representations within the library.

mpl_squares
    Playing with basic initial settings and rendering usint matplotlib
scatter_squares
    Playing with scatter plotting using both axis, as well as slightly more complex data structures.
random_walk
    Stores a class as well as initialization attributes for generating random walk points
rw_visual
    Uses a scatter plot to map the points of random walk.
