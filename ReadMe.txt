This is a project I will use to learn more of the data science and visualization of data aspects of coding.
This program uses matplotlib to build off of, and is basically me exploring various types of data representations within the library.

grasping basics:
    mpl_squares
        Playing with basic initial settings and rendering usint matplotlib
    scatter_squares
        Playing with scatter plotting using both axis, as well as slightly more complex data structures.
    random_walk
        Stores a class as well as initialization attributes for generating random walk points
    rw_visual
        Uses a scatter plot to map the points of random walk.
    die
        Stores the class housing dice attributes, and methods.
    die_visual
        Is used to generate a visual representation of the frequencies of each number being rold at random/ determined sample size. Which is rendered into a .svg file whic can be viewed in the browser.

highs_lows
    This will be used to parse and compare Weather data stored in CSV format.
world_population
    This is used to parse through Json files and map world population counts to a redered visual.
